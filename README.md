# UCCNC-Control-Panel
Physical interface to a CNC running on a UCCNC control (http://cncdrive.com/UCCNC.html) using Modbus RTU and a ESP32 as the microcontroller.

In the "src" folder, you will find the "Main.cpp" file. This code is the firmware for you ESP32.
In the "UCCNC Macro" folder, you will find the "M300.txt" file. Place this file in the "Macro" folder of the profiles you use with UCCNC.

If you need all the instructions on how to build and setup this, an Instructables is on the way!
